A professional end-to-end project that manages a car rental website using the shared vehicle method.
The project contains a user interface that allows registered users to borrow a car, view the loans made by them, and return it. When making a return, the system calculates the cost based on the length of the loan, the vehicle model, and the price of fuel, and makes a payment.
In addition, the site contains an administrator interface that allows you to add, update, and delete car models, vehicles, and different drive types, as well as view all loans made on the site.
There is also the option for the guest to view the vehicles on the site without the rental option.
The site is designed in a clean, uniform, and attractive line and provides a maximum user experience.

Development languages:
Client side: react, server side: c# (built using the N-Tiers architecture) Database: sql.
The project implements advanced React libraries such as: axios, redux, and redux-thunk, and uses extensive design libraries such as mui
